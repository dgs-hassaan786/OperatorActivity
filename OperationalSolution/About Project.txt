Hi team as per the requirement I've tried to perform the best. Let me discuss the issues and clarify them accordingly

Scenario 1:

-- Yup code and db have errors 
-- just corrected and apply the optimize approach from the beginning

-- The Architectural structure is simple, low coupled and high cohesion as one could understand
-- Note: I have used much of my selfed libraries

-- Similarly SOA is implemented and Clients are separated out inorder to achieve horizontal scaling
-- I just used webapi2 as SOA and inside client application implemented the angularjs with MVC

-- Lets discuss the strategies

DB
-- There are lack of relation and normalization
-- SP are not optimized
-- similarly with (no lock) was not implemented

-- why i m calculating fields inside the sp? (there were repetition and it could be performance downgrade) so i just moved the calculation field inside the business logic

Domain
-- Implemented Repository Pattern with Dapper

Client
-- I have provided the 2 views
1) the simple one as required
2) Sum fun and advancement

If you have any issue and required clarification, kindly contact me.
Thanks
